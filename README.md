## FOSS Clubs Logo Generator

This is a logo generator for FOSS Clubs, an initiative by FOSS United to promote free and open-source culture and collaboration among students on college campuses. 

This logo generator is an extended resource to the [FOSS Clubs Design Library](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1319240238306581196). 

## How It Works

Edits are made in the SVG version of logos and then saved.

The generated logos can be used in social media posts, videos, and other design collateral created by FOSS Clubs. Contributing to the project makes you a part of it. 

## Credits

This logo generator is inspired by the [TinkerHub's Campus Logo Generator](https://github.com/tinkerhub/campus-logo-generator).
